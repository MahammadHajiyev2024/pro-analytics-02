These are **commonly used third-party Python packages** that extend core functionality.
They are **not included in the Python Standard Library** and must be installed as needed.

- Use **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** for structured/tabular predictive modeling.
- Use **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
- These frameworks remain core even as deep learning and LLMs expand — they form the quantitative foundation of data science.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Text processing and language understanding in Python can range from simple keyword analysis to advanced generative models.
For most analytics projects, focus on lightweight tools first, then explore classical and modern NLP frameworks as needed.

| [`textblob`](https://pypi.org/project/textblob/) | Easy-to-use text analysis library for tokenization, sentiment, and tagging (built on NLTK). | [Docs](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) |
| [`wordcloud`](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) | Generate visual word clouds from text data for exploratory analysis. | [Docs](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) |

| [`spacy`](https://pypi.org/project/spacy/) | Industrial-strength NLP with pretrained models for tokenization, NER, and dependency parsing (~50 MB + models ~300 MB). | [Docs](https://spacy.io/) |
| [`sentence-transformers`](https://pypi.org/project/sentence-transformers/) | Modern library for semantic embeddings and text similarity; compact and LLM-compatible. | [Docs](https://www.sbert.net/) |
| [`transformers`](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) | Hugging Face Transformers for pretrained and generative language models (large, ~500 MB+ with models). | [Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/) |



**Guidance**

- For web and text extraction, start with **BeautifulSoup** and **regex**.
- For simple analysis and sentiment, use **TextBlob** or **NLTK**.
- For modern semantic tasks (similarity, clustering, embeddings), use **Sentence Transformers**.
- For advanced or generative NLP, move to **Transformers** or hosted LLM APIs.

Traditional NLP libraries (*NLTK*, *spaCy*) remain valuable for learning language structure and preprocessing,
but for summarization, classification, and semantic tasks, LLMs and embedding models now outperform classical pipelines.

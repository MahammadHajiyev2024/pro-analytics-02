## While Working on the Project

Follow these steps when working on a professional Python project.

1. [Git pull](01-git-pull-before-changes.md)
2. [Update and run checks/tests](02-update-and-check.md)
3. [Build and serve documentation](03-build-serve-docs.md)
4. Run Python and/or notebooks. See [Run Python](04a-run-python.md) or [Run Notebooks](04b-run-notebook.md)
5. [Git add-commit-push](05-git-add-commit-push.md)
6. [Modify and debug](06-modify-and-debug.md)

## Important

- Always pull the latest changes before starting to avoid merge conflicts.
- Test your project before each `git add-commit-push`.
- Make frequent commits when enhancing a project.

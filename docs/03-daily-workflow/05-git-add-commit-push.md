# ðŸ”µ Git Add, Commit, and Push to GitHub

Use a terminal in VS Code (PowerShell, zsh, or bash).

**IMPORTANT**
- Replace the commit message with a clear and descriptive note about what you added or changed.
- Wrap the commit message in double quotes.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Your message here"
git push -u origin main
```

After subsequent changes, you can shorten the last command to:

```shell
git push
```

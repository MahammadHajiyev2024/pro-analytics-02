# ðŸ”µ Modify and Debug

When working on a project, always open the project repository folder in VS Code.

In general, all terminal commands should be executed in the **root project folder**.
For example, when working in this project, all commands would be executed in the `pro-analytics-02` folder.

## Reminders

- Use the VS Code menu to turn on Auto Save (**File / Auto Save**), or remember to save your changes as you work.
- Test your code and ensure it runs successfully.
- When working on a team, do not git add-commit-push if the code doesn't run.
- Comment out content as needed to get a version that runs without errors before doing git add-commit-push.
- If you encounter errors, use debugging tools or strategically placed print or logging statements to help identify issues.
- Use git add-commit-push frequently to commit small sets of well-labeled changes to the repository.
- A good commit history helps identify where things might have gone wrong (and when they got fixed).

## Core Analytics Techniques

- [ ] Descriptive statistics - Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- [ ] Data visualization and exploration - Charts, graphs, and summary views
- [ ] Filtering, sorting, and slicing data - Extract specific subsets for analysis
- [ ] Grouping and aggregation - Summarize data by categories (e.g., SUM, AVG)
- [ ] Pivot tables, cross-tabulation, and summaries - Reshape and aggregate data
- [ ] Basic SQL querying (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN) - Retrieve and combine datasets

---

## Data Preparation Techniques

- [ ] Data cleaning - Handle typos, inconsistent values
- [ ] Handling missing values - Fill, drop, or flag missing data
- [ ] Detecting and filtering outliers - Identify and handle extreme values
- [ ] Deduplication - Remove duplicate records
- [ ] Type conversion and normalization - Ensure consistency and accuracy
- [ ] Encoding categorical variables - One-hot, label, or ordinal encoding
- [ ] Feature creation and transformation - Generate new variables for analysis
- [ ] Merging and joining datasets - Combine data from multiple sources
- [ ] Standardizing units and formats - Align dates, currencies, and scales.
- [ ] ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT - Move and prepare data for analysis

---

## Data Modeling & Warehousing

- [ ] Star and snowflake schema design - Organize data for efficient queries
- [ ] Fact and dimension table definitions - Support multi-dimensional analysis
- [ ] Creating and populating a data warehouse - Structure and store historical data

---

## OLAP Processing

- [ ] Slicing - Filter data along one dimension, creating a 2D view (e.g., sales for "Region A")
- [ ] Dicing - Filter data along multiple dimensions, creating a sub-cube (e.g., sales for "Region A," "Electronics," "2023")
- [ ] Roll-up - Aggregate data to a higher level (e.g., Daily to Monthly or Store to Region)
- [ ] Drill-down - Expand data to a more detailed level (e.g., Year to Quarter to Month)

---

## Warehouse Management

- [ ] Designing efficient queries - Optimize data retrieval
- [ ] Managing Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) - Track historical changes over time

---

## Business Intelligence & Reporting

- [ ] Defining KPIs and metrics - Key performance indicators and measurements
- [ ] Designing dashboards for clarity and impact - Visual insights at a glance
- [ ] Building interactive reports - Filters, slicers, and dynamic views
- [ ] Storytelling with data and visual narratives - Communicate insights effectively
- [ ] Refreshing and automating reports - Ensure data stays up-to-date
- [ ] Data blending - Combine data from multiple sources
- [ ] User access control and data security - Manage permissions and protection

---

## Machine Learning & Prediction

- [ ] Classification and regression basics - Predict categories or numeric values
- [ ] Splitting data into training and test sets - Prepare for evaluation
- [ ] Feature selection and feature engineering - Improve model quality
- [ ] Evaluating models - Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- [ ] Avoiding overfitting and using cross-validation - Improve generalization
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning - Optimize model parameters
- [ ] Model deployment basics - Make models accessible and usable

---

## Applied Analytics

- [ ] Web scraping and text mining (NLP) - Extract and analyze text data
- [ ] Time series forecasting - Predict future values over time
- [ ] Recommendation systems - Suggest items based on user patterns
- [ ] Streaming data analytics - Real-time insights from continuous data
- [ ] \*Kafka and event-driven pipelines - High-volume real-time processing
- [ ] Graph analytics - Discover relationships in connected data

---

## Advanced & Emerging Techniques

- [ ] Semantic search and embeddings - Context-aware search and retrieval
- [ ] Integrating AI/LLMs in workflows - Enhance analytics workflows with generative tools
- [ ] Data orchestration (Prefect / Airflow) - Automate and schedule pipelines

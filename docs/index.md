# Pro Analytics 02: Setup and Workflow Guide

This repository provides a clear, concise guide to help set up a machine for Python projects,
initialize a new Python project, and follow a repeatable project workflow
when developing professional Python projects.

The instructions are divided into three parts.

- Go to [ðŸŸ¢ Set Up Machine](01-set-up-machine/index.md) to **set up a machine** for Python projects.

- Go to [ðŸŸ  Project Initialization](02-set-up-project/index.md) to **set up a new Python project**.

- Go to [ðŸ”µ Daily Workflow](03-daily-workflow/index.md) for ongoing project development.


## Important

- Follow the instructions carefully.
- Follow the instructions in the recommended order.
- Verify each step before proceeding.

## Celebrate

Follow each step carefully.
We have helped hundreds of new analysts get started with professional Python.
Verify you can run both a script and a notebook successfully.
Then, celebrate. There are a lot of steps to getting started with professional Python.

## Follow The Proven Path Provided

Hopefully each step is not too bad and things go smoothly.
When they don't, it's expected.
Part of the reason we get hired is to "figure things out," and we are here to help you do that.

Learn to run a web search, and experiment with free AI assistants to help explain and provide any additional details needed.
Remember, **you** are in charge.
These instructions work.
You are welcome to deviate if you agree to invest the time and energy to ensure your alternate path works.

## Explore

After this where the power and joy of working with Python begins.
Keep good notes.
Save the working versions and experiment with changes. For example:

- Rename a variable.
- Add a new statement.
- Comment things out.
- Rename a function.
- View the logs. Log something new.

Working with code is an enjoyable and rewarding way to learn.
If you enjoy puzzles, getting value from data is a great way to earn a living.

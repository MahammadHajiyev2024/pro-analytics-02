# ðŸŸ¢ Verify Machine Setup

With your terminal open in your Repos folder, run the following commands, copy and paste them one at a time, hitting ENTER after each:

```bash
git --version
uv --version
code --version
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
code .
```

If versions or git config commands do NOT work correctly, re-do the associated installation and configuration steps above.
Work with an AI assistant (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, or other) to resolve any issues.

If `code .` doesnâ€™t work, re-run the installation and ensure that **Add to PATH** is checked during installation.

When all of these are true, your setup is complete:

- [ ] You can see hidden files and folders.
- [ ] You can see file extensions.
- [ ] All three version commands respond with version numbers.
- [ ] Your Git configuration information is correct.
- [ ] You can open VS Code with `code .`

Congratulations â€” your professional analytics environment is ready to go!
(Honestly, getting set up correctly IS the hardest part about using Python for analytics - time to take a break and celebrate!)

# ðŸŸ  Enable GitHub Pages (for Documentation)

Before leaving GitHub, turn on **GitHub Pages** so this project can publish its documentation site (built from `docs/` using MkDocs). This gives you a professional, shareable site for your project instructions, setup steps, and technical notes.

1. In your new repository, click the **Settings** tab (top right).
2. In the left sidebar, select **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment / Source**, choose **GitHub Actions**
4. Click the **Code** tab to return to the regular view.

Once enabled, GitHub will automatically build and publish your MkDocs documentation whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Analytics Project Documentation

Why bother with documentation:

- Analytics work requires **clear communication**, not just code
- MkDocs and GitHub Pages provide a **clean, professional documentation site**
- Anyone can read the project docs in a browser
- It provides a separate **documentation site** from your **code and report**, just like real-world projects

## Why Learn GitHub Pages?

Many data-science professionals build a personal portfolio site using GitHub Pages to showcase projects. 
We can use GitHub Pages as a free way to host a data-science portfolio site or client-side web site that links to projects. 

GitHub Pages is mentioned as one of the "5 places to host your data science portfolio" along with GitHub itself.

Not every analytics project uses GitHub Pages, but it is a valuable skill for those who want to present their work professionally.

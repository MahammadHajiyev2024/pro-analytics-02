# ðŸŸ  Start a New Project in GitHub

This page provides instructions to copy an existing repository in GitHub.

## Option 1. Copy a Repository in GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. In your browser, navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you want to copy.
3. Choose The Copy Method
   - To fork, click the Fork button in the upper-right corner.
   - To use a **template** (an example project with a full set of project files), click the green "Use this template button" and select Create a new repository.
   - We recommended starting with the [associated starter template](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics-02-starter) to start a new project professionally.
4. Name Your Repository
   - Enter a **new name** for your copy of the repository. For Python projects: Use all lowercase. Use dashes between words. Never leave spaces in the repository name.
5. Make it public.
6. Complete the process as needed to create repository from template or confirm the fork.

## Option 2. Create a New Repository in GitHub (with README.md)

1. Log in to GitHub. Open your browser and log in to your GitHub account.

2. Go to the "Create Repository" Page

   - In the top-right corner of GitHub, click the + dropdown menu.
   - Select New repository.

3. Name Your Repository

   - Enter a name for your new repository.
   - IMPORTANT: Follow Naming Guidelines for Python Projects:
     - Use all lowercase.
     - Use dashes between words.
     - NEVER USE spaces or special characters.
     - Good Examples: my-python-project, python-experiments, baseball-stats, python-personal-project, website-analytics, student-impact-analysis

4. Provide a brief description of your project. This is optional but recommended.

5. Select the `Public` option so others can view your repository. You may always use a fake name.

6. **IMPORTANT: Add a Default README File**

   - Check the box for Add a README file. This file is essential for cloning and initializing your project.

7. Click the `Create repository` button to finalize the process and create your repo in GitHub.

## IMPORTANT

- If you forget to add a README file, delete the repository and start over. This time, check the box to add a default README.
- The subsequent steps will NOT work the same if the new repository does not have a file in the repo already.
